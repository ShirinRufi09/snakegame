Snake Game
A desktop-based Snake Game built using core Java, demonstrating strong fundamentals in object-oriented programming, multithreading, event handling, and GUI development. The project is structured with modular classes to manage game logic, keyboard input, rendering, and thread control, resulting in smooth and responsive gameplay.

Features
Real-time snake movement using keyboard controls
Dynamic food generation and score tracking
Collision detection with walls and snake body
Multithreaded game loop for consistent speed and responsiveness
Clean, modular object-oriented design

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
Core Java
OOP principles (classes, objects, encapsulation)
Java AWT/Swing for GUI rendering
Keyboard event listeners for real-time input handling
Multithreading for game loop control
Data abstraction using helper classes

🧩 Project Structure
Main – Entry point and game initialization
Window – Game window setup and configuration
SquarePanel – Game board rendering and UI updates
KeyboardListener – Handles keyboard input
ThreadsController – Manages game loop and threading
DataOfSquare & Tuple – Stores game state and coordinate data

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Strengthened core Java and OOP fundamentals
Gained hands-on experience with multithreading and event-driven programming
Improved problem-solving skills through game logic and state management
